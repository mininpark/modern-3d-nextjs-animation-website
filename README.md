This is a first NextJS project to learn how to implement GSAP and review the previous project
- React project architecture and folder structure
- Next13 application structure
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex using Tailwind CSS
  - No BEM & Kinda ugly class names (complicated to use :before, :after)
  - Tailwind and Class Name Props Don’t Mix Well
  - It’s Harder to Find Components in Dev Tools
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients using GSAP Animation
  - Need to improve: Re-implement same GSAP Animation into different Ref
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost all devices using Tailwind CSS
